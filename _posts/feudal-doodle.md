## Introduction
In the ever-evolving world of mobile gaming, BCS Games' latest title, "Feudal Doodle," stands out with its innovative
wave-based combat system where players draw their attacks to defeat enemies. In this case study, I'll share my journey
as the lead in look development and my contributions to the game's unique visual style and engaging gameplay.

## Role and Responsibilities
As the head of look development for "Feudal Doodle," my role encompassed a wide range of responsibilities:

**Wave System and AI Involvement:**
Played a significant role in developing the game's wave system and AI, enhancing player engagement and challenge.

**Technical Innovation:**
Developed a custom rendering pipeline in Unity for a distinctive hand-drawn look, using a hatch-gradient style.

**Asset Development:**
Modeled and rigged numerous character models and environment assets, ensuring they fit seamlessly within the game's
aesthetic.

## Challenges and Solutions
One of the primary challenges was achieving the hand-drawn appearance that was central to "Feudal Doodle's" identity.
Traditional methods in Unity fell short in delivering the desired aesthetic, prompting me to innovate.

**Solution:**
Custom Rendering Pipeline: I authored a Scriptable Rendering Pipeline in Unity, tailored to produce a unique
hatch-gradient appearance. This involved extensive experimentation and fine-tuning to ensure that all visible objects
in the game maintained a consistent and appealing hand-drawn look.

## Tools and Technologies
Leveraging a suite of cutting-edge tools was crucial in bringing "Feudal Doodle" to life:

**Unity:**
Utilized for overall game development, with a focus on custom scripting and rendering.

**C#:**
Scripted game behaviors and interactions.

**Blender, Houdini FX, and ZBrush:**
Employed for modeling, rigging, and texturing of game assets, contributing to the game's distinct visual style.


## Outcome and Impact
"Feudal Doodle" was successfully launched on iOS and Android app stores. While the user base was modest, the game
received enthusiastic feedback from those who played it, highlighting the engaging gameplay and unique visual style.
My contributions in look development and the wave system played a pivotal role in shaping the game's identity and
enhancing the overall player experience.

## Final Thoughts
Working on "Feudal Doodle" was a remarkable journey that pushed the boundaries of mobile gaming visuals and gameplay.
It exemplified the power of technical innovation and creative problem-solving in the face of development challenges.
