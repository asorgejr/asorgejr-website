## Overview
We at BCS Games are thrilled to announce the launch of our latest mobile game, Feudal Doodle.
This innovative wave-based combat game builds upon the mobile gaming experience with its unique drawing-based attack mechanics and visually stunning graphics, all developed in Unity.

### Unique Combat System
One of the standout features of Feudal Doodle is its combat system. Instead of the traditional tap-and-swipe mechanics, players get to draw their attacks on the screen. This system not only makes the gameplay more interactive but also allows for a wide range of creative strategies.

### Custom Rendering Pipeline
As a software engineer, I took on the exciting challenge of authoring a custom rendering pipeline for Feudal Doodle. This pipeline gives the game its distinctive visual style, featuring a hatch-gradient appearance for all visible objects. This artistic choice not only sets our game apart in terms of aesthetics but also showcases the technical capabilities of our team.

## Behind the Scenes: Unity Development
The development of Feudal Doodle was a journey of innovation and learning. Using Unity, a leading game development platform, we were able to bring our creative vision to life.

**Unity's Flexible Environment:**
The Unity engine provided us with the tools and flexibility needed to experiment with unique game mechanics and visual styles.

**Optimizing Performance:**
Ensuring that the game runs smoothly on a range of devices was a top priority. Our custom rendering pipeline was optimized for performance without compromising on the visual quality.

## Final Thoughts
Feudal Doodle is not just a game; it's a testament to our commitment to innovation and quality in mobile gaming. We believe that this game will provide players with a fresh and engaging experience, and we can't wait for you to try it out.
