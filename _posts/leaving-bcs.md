## Reflecting on Four Remarkable Years at BCS Games
As I turn the page to a new chapter in my professional journey, I want to take a moment to reflect on the past four years at BCS Games. It has been an incredible ride, filled with challenges, learning, and most importantly, growth. Working in the gaming industry allowed me to push the boundaries of creativity and technical skills, particularly with our latest project, Feudal Doodle.

### Key Takeaways from Game Development
Innovative Thinking: Developing games demanded constant innovation. This experience sharpened my problem-solving skills and my ability to think outside the box.
Technical Expertise: Working on various aspects of game development, especially on complex systems like custom rendering pipelines, honed my technical abilities.
Team Collaboration: Building successful games was a team effort. I learned the value of collaboration, communication, and collective creativity.

## Embracing the World of Web Development
Now, I am excited to announce that I am transitioning into web development. This decision comes from a desire to explore new technologies and apply my skills in a different context.

### Why Web Development?
Expanding Skill Set: Web development offers a unique platform to apply and expand my programming skills, especially in areas like front-end technologies, UX/UI design, and backend systems.
Impactful Solutions: The web is ubiquitous, and developing for it means creating solutions that can have a global impact.
Continuous Learning: The ever-evolving landscape of web technologies is a perfect match for my passion for continuous learning and adapting to new challenges.

## Looking Forward
As I embark on this new journey, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to building impactful web solutions, learning new technologies, and contributing to the web development community.
